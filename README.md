# 🔤 Hangman - Python Game  

Welcome to **Hangman!** 🎮  
In this classic word-guessing game, you must correctly guess the **hidden fruit name** before you run out of attempts! Can you save yourself from defeat? 🍏🍌🍊  

## 🕹️ How It Works  
1. The computer randomly selects a **fruit name** from a list.  
2. You have **6 attempts** to guess the word **one letter at a time**.  
3. Correct guesses reveal the letter(s) in the word.  
4. Wrong guesses **reduce your attempts**.  
5. If you guess all letters **before running out of attempts**, you win! 🎉  
6. If you run out of attempts, **the game is over** and the word is revealed.  

## 🛠 Features  
✔️ Randomized **fruit names** for a new challenge each time  
✔️ **Guessed letters tracking** to prevent duplicate inputs  
✔️ **6 attempts limit** for added difficulty  
✔️ Interactive and **beginner-friendly gameplay*
